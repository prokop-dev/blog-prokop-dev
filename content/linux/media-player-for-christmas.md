This Christmas decided to gift to my significant other a [Game Of Thrones](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Game-Thrones-Seasons-Region-Blu-ray/dp/B08DGR1SHV?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=bartprokop-21&linkCode=ur2&linkId=c8c5db0145b84d9325946060f1b19365&camp=1634&creative=6738) Blu Ray set (4k, UHD - 33 discs total).
This post cover all what I needed to do to get it watched on living room's TV (which is LG OLED).
The first obvious obstacle has ocurred - I do not have the Blu Ray Player (not even mentioning UHD Blue Ray).
It is 2022/23 and physical media are slightly a thing of past.
Unless you of course want the highest fidelity - the kind of that cannot be delivered via streaming (yet).

# Getting ReadyMedia installed

To install [ReadyMedia](https://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna), invoke:

```
pacman -S minidlna
```
